Signals
=======

django-crudbuilder comes with built-in signals to perform/execute specific actions after post create and post update views.
You can able to access ``request`` and ``instance`` in your own handlers.

Usage of these signals you can view in `handlers of example project`_ on Github.

Following are the list of supported signals.::

    post_create_signal         --> runs after modelform.save() in CreateView
    post_update_signal         --> runs after modelform.save() in UpdateView
    post_inline_create_signal  --> runs after inlineformset.save() in CreateView
    post_inline_update_signal  --> runs after inlineformset.save() in UpdateView


post_create_signal
------------------

This signal will loaded/executed soon after the object gets created for specific model. In otherwords this will fires right after the ``modelform.save()`` method gets called during the CreateView.::

    # tutorial/handlers.py
    from django.dispatch import receiver
    from crudbuilder.signals import post_create_signal

    from example.models import Person

    @receiver(post_create_signal, sender=Person)
    def post_create_signal_handler(sender, **kwargs):
        # print "execute after create action"
        request = kwargs['request']
        instance = kwargs['instance']

        instance.created_by = request.user
        instance.save()


post_update_signal
------------------

This signal will loaded/executed soon after the object gets updated for specific model. In otherwords this will fires right after the ``modelform.save()`` method gets called during the UpdateView.::

    # tutorial/handlers.py
    from django.dispatch import receiver
    from crudbuilder.signals import post_update_signal

    from example.models import Person

    @receiver(post_update_signal, sender=Person)
    def post_update_signal_handler(sender, **kwargs):
        # print "execute after update action"
        request = kwargs['request']
        instance = kwargs['instance']

        instance.updated_by = request.user
        instance.save()


post_inline_create_signal
-------------------------

This signal will get executed soon after the inline formset gets saved which means this get fires right after the ``inlineformset.save()`` method gets called in CreateView.::

    # tutorial/handlers.py
    from django.dispatch import receiver
    from crudbuilder.signals import post_inline_create_signal

    @receiver(post_inline_create_signal, sender=Person)
    def post_inline_create_handler(sender, **kwargs):
        request = kwargs['request']
        parent = kwargs['parent']
        children = kwargs['children']

        parent.created_by = request.user
        parent.save()

        for child in children:
            child.created_by = request.user
            child.save()


post_inline_update_signal
-------------------------

This signal will get executed soon after the inline formset gets updated which means this get fires right after the ``inlineformset.save()`` method gets called in UpdateView.::

    # tutorial/handlers.py
    from django.dispatch import receiver
    from crudbuilder.signals import post_inline_update_signal

    @receiver(post_inline_update_signal, sender=Person)
    def post_inline_update_handler(sender, **kwargs):
        request = kwargs['request']
        parent = kwargs['parent']
        children = kwargs['children']

        parent.updated_by = request.user
        parent.save()

        for child in children:
            child.updated_by = request.user
            child.save()
